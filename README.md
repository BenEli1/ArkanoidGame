##Arkanoid Game
Welcome to our Arkanoid game! This game was developed as an assignment for an Object-Oriented Programming course using Java. It features four exciting levels, each with its own unique challenges.

In this game, you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen and use it to deflect a ball towards blocks at the top of the screen. Each block you break earns you 10 points, and an extra 100 points are earned for each level that you pass.

To control the paddle, you can use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard. You can also press the "p" key to pause the game, and then press the spacebar to continue playing.

The game is over when you reach the final level or when you lose all of your game balls. So be sure to keep an eye on the ball and use your paddle to keep it in play!

We hope you enjoy playing our Arkanoid game and wish you the best of luck in your quest to reach the final level. Have fun!
